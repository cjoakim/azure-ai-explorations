## Embedding 


```

  api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),  
  api_version = "2024-02-01",
  azure_endpoint = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")

## Chat Completion

### Basic Example

```
pip install openai

import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

endpoint = "https://youopenai.openai.azure.com/"
model_name = "gpt-4.1-mini"
deployment = "gpt-4.1-mini"

subscription_key = "<your-api-key>"
api_version = "2024-12-01-preview"

client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_version=api_version,
    azure_endpoint=endpoint,
    api_key=subscription_key,
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "I am going to Paris, what should I see?",
        }
    ],
    max_completion_tokens=800,
    temperature=1.0,
    top_p=1.0,
    frequency_penalty=0.0,
    presence_penalty=0.0,
    model=deployment
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Multi-Turn Example

```
import os
from openai import AzureOpenAI

endpoint = "https://youopenai.openai.azure.com/"
model_name = "gpt-4.1-mini"
deployment = "gpt-4.1-mini"

subscription_key = "<your-api-key>"
api_version = "2024-12-01-preview"

client = AzureOpenAI(
